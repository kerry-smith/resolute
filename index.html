          <p>When you accept this Agreement and complete the RESOLUTE registration process for membership, you become a member to RESOLUTE. Each membership is to be used for insurance subscribers and dependents on one common policy.  Spouses, who are Medicare beneficiaries, and subscribe to the same insurance carrier and insurance product are deemed to have one common policy. Individuals with legal Power of Attorney are permitted to use this site upon approval of submitted documentation. Illegal or improper use by someone to whom you have given permission to use your account puts your account at risk. So it is very important that you do not share your password with anyone. If your Membership is terminated for violating this Agreement, you will not be entitled to a refund. RESOLUTE’s express permission will be necessary before you are allowed to enroll with RESOLUTE again.
          </p>
          <p>RESOLUTE is not an attorney firm and does not represent any member in a court of law.  RESOLUTE reserves the right to refuse service for insurance issues that arise prior to becoming a member.  RESOLUTE is unable to assist clients if timely filing statutes have been exhausted.

          <span class="title">2. CHARGES, BILLING AND THE REFERRAL BONUS</span>
          <p>RESOLUTE reserves the right to change our fees or billing methods at any time and RESOLUTE will provide notice of any such change at least thirty days in advance in the same manner described above for changes to the Member Agreement. Any notifications of changes will be sent to the E-Mail address that you provide for your account. It will be your responsibility to keep your E-Mail address updated and valid at all times. (Remember, you may change your E-Mail address on your account by accessing www.ResoluteHCA.com and selecting Your Account from the Enroll tab.) RESOLUTE also has the right to collect applicable taxes and impose premium surcharges for some areas of the service and these surcharges may apply even during your free referral bonus period. The answers to many common billing questions can be found by going to “FAQ’s – Frequently Asked Questions” or contact a customer service representative by using the “Contact” link on the top navigation bar on the site. If you don’t like the changes in fees or billing methods, you may cancel your Membership at any time, but RESOLUTE will not refund any remaining portion of the monthly fee when you cancel your Membership.
          </p>
          <p>Once your account is activated into a membership with the appropriate charge, it will be renewed automatically, unless you cancel before the next billing date. The RESOLUTE billing date begins ten (10) days before the 1st of each month. If you do not want to continue with your membership, you must cancel BEFORE the “Next billing” date. There will be no refunds for late cancellations, or cancellations that are made after the billing date. You are entitled to continue with RESOLUTE consulting services until the end of the month for which you have paid.
          </p>
          <p>Members who elect to pay dues annually will receive twelve (12) months of consulting services for the price of eleven (11). If you decide to cancel an annual membership, you are entitled to a pro-rata refund for full months paid but not used.
          </p>
          <p>RESOLUTE retains the right to charge a $60.00 enrollment fee per policy.  This fee, in addition to the first’s month consulting fee, is due at the time of enrollment.  The enrollment fee covers the cost of administrative services required to establish an account, collect historical information, determine initial cause of action, and establish partnerships with your health plan, medical provider, and legal representative, if applicable.  If your RESOLUTE policy lapses for non-payment of monthly premium, and more than three months has lapsed, you are required to pay the lesser of back premiums or the current enrollment fee to continue services.
          </p>
          <p>Enrollees with a membership in good standing (e.g., account is not past due or inactive) are eligible for two referral bonuses per year.  A referral bonus is equivalent to one month’s consulting fee.  Members may earn a referral bonus after the applicant, in which they have referred, has been a member in good standing for three consecutive months. We reserve the right to limit referral bonuses to two per calendar year.  For monthly subscribers, the referral bonus is awarded on the fourth month of activity for the referral account.  For annual subscribers, the referral bonus is awarded at the end of the annual election period.
          </p>
          <p>To CANCEL, you will log into Your Account at www.ResoluteHCA.com under the Enroll tab. You will be given the option to complete a brief survey.  Your opinion is important and helps us provide the best service possible. You may also cancel, in writing, by submitting your request to RESOLUTE Health Care Advisors, PO Box 376, Laveen, AZ  85339 or submitting a fax to 1 (877) 847-3992.
